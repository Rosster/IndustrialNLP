      "{12588: ['Yodel', 'When you hear the Country and Western singers yodel, do you wish you could do the same thing? Have you tried it, but it never sounded like a real, genuine yodel? The following steps might just help you to be the best yodeler on your block.\\n[[Category:Singing]]\\n\\n== Steps ==\\n=== Yodeling Basics ===\\n#Understand the break. The secret to yodeling is learning to find the break in your voice. All human voices have two distinct vocal registers; your normal or \"chest\" voice and your high or \"head\" voice. The break occurs at the point where your chest voice switches to your head voice. Yodeling is characterized by the jump from chest voice to head voice, while breaking your voice at the same time.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#Find your break. Don\\'t worry - it\\'s not painful! Pick a sound, such as \"oh\" and move your voice from low to high, listening for the break. The point at which the break occurs will be different for everybody.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#*If you\\'re having trouble finding your break, trying howling like a wolf - seriously, it will help!\\n#*Fun fact! The break is created by the epiglottis, a flap at the back of your tongue which prevents you from inhaling food while you eat.\\n#Practice. Practice moving from low to high notes, making sure to emphasize the break. Start with any mid-range note in your chest, using the sound \"oh\". Now jump up to a high note in your head using the sound \"ou\".<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#*Try not to tense up your voice, keep it relaxed.\\n#*Don\\'t let the notes slide smoothly - unlike other singing styles where singers try to move smoothly from one note to the next, the break between notes is essential for yodeling correctly.\\n#Remember the knock knock joke. Knock knock. Who\\'s there? Little old lady. Little-old-lady-WHO! Practice your yodel by singing \"little-old-lady-WHO,\" with the jump from chest voice to head voice occurring between the word \"lady\" and the word \"who\". Go on, try it!<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#Attempt a triad yodel. Most styles of yodeling are founded around three notes - the triad. Try singing the notes A, E, then D to form a triad yodel. The A should be sung in your chest voice, while the E and D notes should be sung in your head voice.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#*Once you\\'ve mastered the triad, try putting the word \"yodel\" in front of it to sing \"yodel-A-E-D!\"\\n#Go through a chord scale. Try singing \"yodel-A-E-D\" for each note on a chord scale. This will allow you to practice your break and also help you to get warmed up!<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]\\n=== Yodeling Better ===\\n# Be forewarned. You are going to sound terrible at first. Learning to yodel well takes time. You will need to put in many hours of practice if you want to sound more like a Swiss milkmaid than a strangled cat. You may also want to give friends, family and nearby neighbors a heads up about your new hobby.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]\\n# Watch yodeling videos. One of the best ways to improve your yodeling technique is to imitate some top notch yodelers. There are loads of great yodeling videos and tutorials that you can watch online. For Alpine yodeling, try watching videos of Franzl Lang. For cowboy yodeling, try Wylie Gustafson or \\'\\'America\\'s Got Talent\\'\\' runner-up Taylor Ware.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 8.jpg|center|550px]]\\n# Listen to CD\\'s. Try to get your hands on some yodeling CD\\'s, so you listen to some yodeling experts and try to sing along. One recommendation is \"U 2 Can Yodel\" by Kerry Christensen, which can be purchased online.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#Play an instrument. If you can play an instrument, such as the guitar, and strum along while you yodel, all the better! Singing along with an instrument will help you stay in tune and make your whole performance more impressive.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 10.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#Practice outdoors. Yodeling began as a method of communication between herders and their stock in the Central Alps. So what better way to get in touch with your inner yodeler than to hit the great outdoors and allow your yodel to echo through the hills. Ideal natural locations include mountain ranges, lakes, rocky gorges or open areas with distant rock faces.<br><br>[[Image:Yodel Step 11.jpg|center|550px]]\\n\\n\\n== Video ==\\n{{Video:Yodel|}}\\n== Tips ==\\n*Just go for it!

Lime zest adds intense flavor to cocktails, desserts and a number of other recipes. The easiest tool for creating fine lime zest for cooking is a microplane, while long garnish strips or cocktail twists can be made with a traditional zester. However, with a little more effort and practice, either form of zest can be created with nothing more than a sharp knife or vegetable peeler.\\n[[Category:Citrus Fruits]]\\n[[Category:Food Cutting Techniques]]\\n\\n== Steps ==\\n=== Using a microplane or fine grater ===\\n#Wash the lime under cool, running water. Rub the limes gently with your fingers to remove grime or waxy substances, even if there is no visible dirt on the lime.<ref>http://www.soyouwanna.com/zest-lime-zester-2935.html</ref> Pat dry with a clean towel to clean the lime further and make it easier to grip.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 1.jpg}}\\n#Place your microplane above a cutting board at a 45-degree angle. A microplane grater is a flat or curved metal kitchen tool with tiny, sharp holes across its surface. It can be used to produce finely grated lime zest with little effort.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 2.jpg}}\\n#*If you have a grater with several sizes of holes, use the smallest size. It may or may not be a microplane, but can be used as a zester nonetheless.\\n#Gently push the lime across the surface of the microplane. Rest your lime on top of the microplane, near the base. Push the lime gently across the blades. This should shave the skin into a fine zest, which will fall onto the cutting board for you to collect.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 3.jpg}}\\n#*Notice that the blades are angled in one direction. Pushing the lime against the cutting edges of the blades will produce zest, while pushing it in the opposite direction will have no effect.<ref>http://www.cookthink.com/reference/199/How_to_zest_a_lime</ref> The cutting edges of the blades should be facing up toward the ceiling.\\n#*If you are using a fine grater instead of a microplane, push as gently as possible to avoid digging into the bitter, white pith beneath the skin.\\n#Rotate the lime to zest the rest of the fruit. Zest the first area until the colored skin has been removed. Once the white pith beneath the skin is revealed, rotate the lime to rub a new section of the colored skin over the microplane in the same way.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 4.jpg}}\\n#*Be careful not to remove the bitter white pith beneath the skin.\\n#Collect the zest and place it in a small bowl. Once the whole lime has been zested, or you have as much zest as you need, set aside the lime for later use. Use a knife to scrape the zest off the cutting board and into a small bowl, or directly into the dish you are cooking as instructed by the recipe.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 5.jpg}}\\n#*You don\\'t need to spend the effort getting every last piece of zest out of the lime. The ends of the lime may be difficult to zest, for instance.\\n#Rinse the microplane immediately or leave it in a warm location to dry out. If you allow the zest residue to dry in the tiny holes of the microplane, it can be difficult to clean out later. Use running water to wash it out immediately, scrubbing with a thick-bristled brush. Alternatively, try using no water at all and setting the microplane near a stove or on a sunny windowsill.

Once the strips have been removed and the white pith beneath is exposed, rotate to an untouched section of the lime. Continue to pull the zester over the lime until you have the amount of zest you need for your recipe.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 10.jpg}}\\n#*The thickness of lime skin varies more than most citrus fruit, so it is difficult to predict how much zest is produced by one lime. If the recipe calls for \"zest from one lime\" without specifying the variety of lime, use approximately two tsp (10 mL) of zest.\\n#Chop the strips of zest finely (optional). If you are using the zest as a decorative garnish, skip this step. If you are using them in a recipe, use a sharp knife to cut the zest into fine pieces.\\n\\n=== Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife ===\\n#Use this method only if you don\\'t have other tools. When you don’t have a microplane or a zester, then a vegetable peeler or paring knife will get the job done. This process isn’t recommended if you want uniform curls or a very fine zest.\\n#Rinse and dry the lime. Hold the lime under running water and rub off grime with your fingers. Pat dry with a clean towel.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 11.jpg}}\\n#Place the lime on a cutting board and hold it with your non-dominant hand. Set a clean cutting board on a stable surface.

If you are left-handed, hold it with your right hand.\\n#Position the vegetable peeler or paring knife. Hold the peeler or knife against the top of the lime, with the blade facing you. Do not try to point the blade away from you, as zesting this way provides less control and increases the odds of cutting yourself.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 12.jpg}}\\n#Methodically peel the zest from the lime. Pull the peeler or knife toward you, pressing lightly into the lime\\'s skin. Ideally, only remove the colored zest portion of the peel, not the white pith underneath. However, press deeper into the pith if it helps keep the knife steady and controlled.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 13.jpg}}\\n#Trim the white pith from the zest unless using strips for garnish. Use your paring knife or any sharp, small knife to remove large pieces of white, fleshy pith from the underside of the peeled zest. This is highly recommended if using the zest in recipes, as the pith adds a bitter taste. However, if you are using the zest strips as garnish or in a cocktail, you do not need to remove the pith.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 14.jpg}}\\n#Chop the zest into small pieces (optional).

This brought users more choice and more features, but also the need for dedicated archive manager applications to fully use the potential of different file formats, either for creating own archives, and for extracting archives received or downloaded.\\n[[Category:Software]]\\n\\n== Steps ==\\n#  <br><br> PeaZip is a freeware cross-platform archive manager that provides a single GUI for Open Source technologies ([[Archive Using 7zip|7-Zip]], FreeArc, PAQ, UPX...) on Windows, Linux, and BSD. The file manager allows both to select files and folders to be archived as Zip files (or other formats), and to select archives to be unzipped.

PeaZip relies on optimized Deflate algorithm for compressing in Zip format, that usually compress 5-10% better than standard Deflate but keeping compatibility with other Zip utilities. 7Z format gives better compression ratio, but is slower than Zip. As quite unique feature for archive management software, PeaZip supports two factor authentication (password plus key file), random password generation, and features an integrated encrypted password manager. \"Advanced\" tab features more fine-grained options, \"Console\" tab transform the task in a command line i.e. for use in scripts or for study purpose, \"Schedule\" tab allows to transform the interactive task in a scheduled one, i.e. for setting up a backup.<br><br>[[Image:Zip and Unzip Files with Peazip Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]\\n#  <br><br> Archive extraction can be started from system context menu, or dragging compressed files on the application, or with \"Extract\" button in program\\'s tool bar.

Zooming in Internet Explorer 7 allowed text to overflow off of the screen, and required you to manipulate a horizontal toolbar to view all the information on a web page. In Internet Explorer 8, the text is wrapped and the horizontal toolbar is no longer needed, making for a more user-friendly zooming experience. Internet Explorer also scales elements within the web page, rather than simply magnifying them. For this reason, the zoom feature in Internet Explorer 8 is now called Adaptive Zoom.\\n\\n== Warnings ==\\n*One commonly experienced problem among IE 7 and 8 users is new web pages that are opened at a strange zoom level, like 200%.

This article will show you how to zoom in for a closeup of your browser or desktop.\\n[[Category:Mac OS X]]\\n\\n== Steps ==\\n\\n=== Zooming in a Browser ===\\n# Launch a browser. Any browser will do: this method works the same on all!<br><br>[[Image:Update 1.png|center]]\\n# Press Command and + (plus/equal button). Each repetition will increase the zoom by degrees. You can zoom in to varying degrees in different browsers:<br><br>[[Image:Update 2.png|center]]\\n#* Up to 7x with Safari.\\n#* Up to 8x with Chrome and Firefox.\\n#* No limit with Opera, and each zoom is smaller than with other browsers.\\n#* Pressing Command-0 will reset your zoom level in all browsers.\\n#* Pressing Command-(minus) will zoom out in all browsers.\\n\\n===  Zooming the Monitor ===\\n# Turn on Universal Access. From the Apple menu, select \"Preferences.\" In the System Preferences pane, click on Universal Access.<br><br>[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 1.png|center|550px]]\\n# Click the Seeing button. In the Universal Access control panel, click the Seeing button to adjust the various visual controls of the interface.<br><br>[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 2.png|center|550px]]\\n# Set Zoom to On. In the Seeing control panel, locate and click the Zoom control button. You can also activate (and de-activate) zooming by pressing Command-option-8.<br><br>[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 3.png|center|550px]]\\n# Click \"Options.\" Locate the \"Options…\" button to the right of the Zoom activation buttons. This will let you fine-tune your zooming controls.<br><br>[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 4.png|center|550px]]\\n#* Maximum Zoom: when you press the zoom-in keyboard shortcut (Command-option-equals), your screen will zoom to the magnification you set here. You can set the zoom anywhere from 1.1x the current screen size, to 20x the current screen size! \\n#* Minimum Zoom: when you press the zoom-out keyboard shortcut (Command-option-minus), the screen will only zoom out to this preset level.\\n#** In either case, continuing to hold down the keyboard shortcut will continue zooming in or out to the maximum levels.\\n#* Show preview rectangle when zoomed out: To see what part of  your screen will be magnified, enable this. It will show as a black rectangle on your screen.\\n#* Smooth images: check this to add a smoothing function to the zoomed-in screen. While it improves the look of zoomed-in images, it can make text appear a little blurry.\\n#* Zoom follows keyboard focus: when you are zoomed in, and type something that goes beyond the boundaries of the zoomed area, the screen will track your cursor so your text will always be displayed.\\n#* Continuously with pointer: when zoomed in, the screen moves continuously as you move your cursor.\\n#* Only when the pointer reaches an edge: your screen stays put until your cursor reaches the edge of the screen.\\n#* So the pointer is at or near the center of the image: this keeps your cursor in the center of the screen, and only the screen moves.\\n#* If your mouse features a scroll wheel, you can hold down the modifier keys and scroll. Rather than a quick zoom in and out to the preset maximum and minimum levels, using the scroll wheel provides a smooth, slow zoom in and back out. Set the modifier keys by clicking in the field, then pressing your preferred modifier keys.\\n#* When you\\'ve finished setting the options, click the \"Done\" button.\\n\\n===  Zooming in a Window ===\\n# Zoom in a window. Click this checkbox, and rather than zooming your entire screen, a \"magnifying glass\" enlarges everything underneath it. Like zooming the screen, you can adjust the level of zoom with Control-Option-Equals or Minus.<br><br>[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 5.png|center|550px]]\\n# Click on Options. Like regular zoom, zooming in a window has a set of options, as shown in the image below. \\n#* Magnification: sets the zoom level when you activate Zoom in Window (Command-Option-8).\\n#* Stationary: when the window position is set to \"Stationary,\" the zoom window shows in the center of the monitor, and the cursor location determines what appears under the window.\\n#* Follow mouse cursor: the window remains under your cursor, and can be dragged anywhere. This is similar to the way a real magnifying glass works.\\n#* Tiled along edge: sets the zoom area to be a full-length column on the left side of your monitor, displaying zoomed content that tracks your cursor.\\n#* Invert colors turns white to black, black to white, and green to purple. \\n#* Smooth images: smoothes the edges of both text and images.\\n#* Zoom follows keyboard focus: when you are zoomed in, and type something that goes beyond the boundaries of the zoom window, the cursor stays centered in the window while the magnified parts track your keyboard focus—usually your cursor or entry field.\\n#* Enable temporary zoom: holding down Control-option keys will pop up a zoomed window that is active as long as you hold down the modifier keys. When you let go, the window disappears.\\n#* Speak items under mouse after delay: will read whatever text is below your cursor. You can set the time delay from \"Normal,\" which is instantaneous, to \"Maximum,\" which is about five seconds.\\n#* Enable \"Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom\" to give mouse control to your zooming. To set the hot keys, press and hold the desired key or keys. Allowed keys are Shift, Control, Command, and Option, only.\\n#* Adjust Size and Location: Press this button to resize and set the default position for whatever window you\\'ve chosen to display.<ref>Apple Help Center</ref>\\n===  View Option ===\\n#  Go to the menu bar at the top of your computer screen. [[Image:Screen Shot 2014 02 23 at 1.57.40 PM.png|right|181px]]\\n#  Click Zoom in from the drop-down menu. [[Image:Screen Shot 2014 02 23 at 1.59.33 PM.png|right|181px]]\\n#*Do this as many times as you need to get a bigger browser.\\n\\n== Tips ==\\n* Become familiar with the hot key combinations—even if you\\'re not visually impaired, being able to zoom in on something quickly is a very handy feature, whether you just need a closeup, or are showing somebody something from across the room.\\n\\n== Related wikiHows ==\\n*[[Use Picture in Picture Zoom in Mac Os X Lion|How to Use Picture in Picture Zoom in Mac Os X Lion]]\\n*[[Use Multi Touch Gestures in Mac Os X Lion| How to Use Multi Touch Gestures in Mac Os X Lion]]\\n*[[Zoom In or Out on an iPhone or iPod Touch| How to Zoom In or Out on an iPhone or iPod Touch]]\\n*[[Turn off Inertia Scrolling in Os X Lion|How to Turn off Inertia Scrolling in Os X Lion]]\\n\\n== Sources and Citations ==\\n{{reflist}}\\n[[es:hacer un acercamiento en una Mac]]\\n[[it:Zoomare con un Mac]]\\n[[pt:Dar Zoom em um Mac]]\\n[[zh:在Mac上放大]]\\n[[de:Heranzoomen bei einem Mac]]\\n\\n__METHODS__\\n[[fr:zoomer sous Mac]]\\n[[ru:пользоваться Zoom на Mac]]'], 2926029: ['Zoom in on a PC', '[[Zoom Out on a PC|Zooming out]] and in on a PC is very simple.
