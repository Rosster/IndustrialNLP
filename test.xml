      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5221">When you hear the Country and Western singers yodel, do you wish you could do the same thing? Have you tried it, but it never sounded like a real, genuine yodel? The following steps might just help you to be the best yodeler on your block.
[[Category:Singing]]

== Steps ==
=== Yodeling Basics ===
#Understand the break. The secret to yodeling is learning to find the break in your voice. All human voices have two distinct vocal registers; your normal or &quot;chest&quot; voice and your high or &quot;head&quot; voice. The break occurs at the point where your chest voice switches to your head voice. Yodeling is characterized by the jump from chest voice to head voice, while breaking your voice at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
#Find your break. Don't worry - it's not painful! Pick a sound, such as &quot;oh&quot; and move your voice from low to high, listening for the break. The point at which the break occurs will be different for everybody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#*If you're having trouble finding your break, trying howling like a wolf - seriously, it will help!
#*Fun fact! The break is created by the epiglottis, a flap at the back of your tongue which prevents you from inhaling food while you eat.
#Practice. Practice moving from low to high notes, making sure to emphasize the break. Start with any mid-range note in your chest, using the sound &quot;oh&quot;. Now jump up to a high note in your head using the sound &quot;ou&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
#*Try not to tense up your voice, keep it relaxed.
#*Don't let the notes slide smoothly - unlike other singing styles where singers try to move smoothly from one note to the next, the break between notes is essential for yodeling correctly.
#Remember the knock knock joke. Knock knock. Who's there? Little old lady. Little-old-lady-WHO! Practice your yodel by singing &quot;little-old-lady-WHO,&quot; with the jump from chest voice to head voice occurring between the word &quot;lady&quot; and the word &quot;who&quot;. Go on, try it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#Attempt a triad yodel. Most styles of yodeling are founded around three notes - the triad. Try singing the notes A, E, then D to form a triad yodel. The A should be sung in your chest voice, while the E and D notes should be sung in your head voice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]
#*Once you've mastered the triad, try putting the word &quot;yodel&quot; in front of it to sing &quot;yodel-A-E-D!&quot;
#Go through a chord scale. Try singing &quot;yodel-A-E-D&quot; for each note on a chord scale. This will allow you to practice your break and also help you to get warmed up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
=== Yodeling Better ===
# Be forewarned. You are going to sound terrible at first. Learning to yodel well takes time. You will need to put in many hours of practice if you want to sound more like a Swiss milkmaid than a strangled cat. You may also want to give friends, family and nearby neighbors a heads up about your new hobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
# Watch yodeling videos. One of the best ways to improve your yodeling technique is to imitate some top notch yodelers. There are loads of great yodeling videos and tutorials that you can watch online. For Alpine yodeling, try watching videos of Franzl Lang. For cowboy yodeling, try Wylie Gustafson or ''America's Got Talent'' runner-up Taylor Ware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 8.jpg|center|550px]]
# Listen to CD's. Try to get your hands on some yodeling CD's, so you listen to some yodeling experts and try to sing along. One recommendation is &quot;U 2 Can Yodel&quot; by Kerry Christensen, which can be purchased online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]
#Play an instrument. If you can play an instrument, such as the guitar, and strum along while you yodel, all the better! Singing along with an instrument will help you stay in tune and make your whole performance more impressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 10.jpg|center|550px]]
#Practice outdoors. Yodeling began as a method of communication between herders and their stock in the Central Alps. So what better way to get in touch with your inner yodeler than to hit the great outdoors and allow your yodel to echo through the hills. Ideal natural locations include mountain ranges, lakes, rocky gorges or open areas with distant rock faces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yodel Step 11.jpg|center|550px]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">YOLOing is a very unintelligent activity. You probably will be frowned upon by many, and get invited to less parties. But, if you really want to YOLO, this is where to go.
[[Category:Personal Development]]
[[Category:Nonconformist Styles]]
== Steps ==
#   Try not to be boring. Don't ever sit down with your laptop, phone, tablet, anything like that for more than 20 to 30 minutes (unless it's homework.) Still, try to do something that never bores you or anyone around you! Live like there is no tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yolo Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
# Call up a friend or two on the weekend and do something that you can look back on! Make cupcakes not so seriously, go to the mall and people search or try on a bunch of things and take hideous or super cute pictures. Go see a movie premiere with some guys. Just do something you don't always do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yolo Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#   If none of your friends are in town, listen to some music on full blast and dance around. Go on a LONG walk down a street that you almost never go on. Learn how to do something random (the splits, how to play guitar, or how to ride a bike with no handlebars.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yolo Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
# Make a fool out of your self in public. Don't steal though, and don't be rude in public. Simply stop caring so much about how people look at you. Go about your everyday activities with a little more spice than you normally would. Make yourself remembered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yolo Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#   Be yourself. By doing this, people will look up to you and you might start a fad or something. You want to be your BEST self, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Yolo Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]

== Video ==
{{Video:Yolo|}}

== Tips ==
*Think of life this way: what did you do yesterday? think of what you had for breakfast yesterday, now loo at what you are doing today you are reading this at whatever time it is... think how fast time has been moving and chances are if you are desperate enough to search how to live life then you are wasting it.
*Now think of another thing for me: what do you want for Christmas? Hanukkah? some(most) might say something expensive like an iPhone 5 or a laptop or something ridiculous and selfish like that.  Now I want you to think of starving people anywhere all they want is food and we have the nerve to say we WANT ELECTRONICS or I will die if I lose my phone and we sit and eat things like it's a hobby. appreciate what you have live life happy because you have a lot!

== Warnings ==
*YOLO doesn't mean go out and party,jump off cliffs and stuff it's for fun nor drinking. Don't listen to the song or whatever

== Steps ==
#Open a picture or your portrait where a pimple is seen on Photoshop. To open the picture in Photoshop, go to File&gt;Open and look for the file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zap Zits in Photoshop Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Then go to your Healing Brush Tool and select Healing Brush Tool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zap Zits in Photoshop Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Apply the healing brush tool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zap Zits in Photoshop Step 3 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#* Apply by sampling first the skin or pixels without the pimple. Sample the pixels by holding the Alt key and clicking on the area without the pimple.
#* With the sampled pixels, brush the pimple; Photoshop will automatically blend pixels and erase your targeted area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">This article explains how to set up a rifle scope from the initial mounting, through to &quot;zeroing&quot; your rifle scope.
[[Category:Rifles]]
== Steps ==
#  Once you have mounted your Rifle Scope, set your zero. &quot;Zeroing&quot; you rifle scope is the single most important thing you should do in terms of improving the accuracy of your shot. If you fail to zero your Rifle scope you will not hit your target - FACT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
## Position your eyepiece, set the distance to your shooting eye so the position is correct when in your shooting position. Your image should be sharp and clear when you look through the eyepiece, when this is achieved your know you are in the correct place.
# Level your crosshair. Your rifle should be held in a steady position, the best way to achieve this is to set your rifle on a stand so that the rifle stock is level and square to the ground level. Now you need to rotate the crosshair so that the vertical crosshair is at top dead centre, imagine a line through the crosshair that runs directly through the centre of your rifle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Tighten your mounting base securely insuring that the crosshair remains top dead centre. Check again that your crosshair is top dead centre then, gradually tighten your mounting rings. Tighten each screw only half a thread at a time constantly checking the crosshair to ensure that it has remained top dead centre. Tighten the screws using opposite corners like when tightening a car head gasket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
# Determine the distance at which you wish to zero your rifle scope. Usually this is the distance at which you are most likely to shoot when in the field. Set a target at the required distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#Get yourself in a steady shooting position, its important that your rifle is steady as any movement will affect you rifle scopes zero position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]
#Remove the caps from your rifle scope's windage and elevation turrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
#Aim at the centre of your target and take your first shot (it is important to do this on a day with minimal wind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
#Now adjust your elevation turret up or down and you windage turret left or right ( depending on where your shot hit the target). What you need to do is adjust the crosshair in the scope to where the shot hit the target - the crosshair must &quot;follow&quot; where the shot hit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 8.jpg|center|550px]]
#Take another shot once adjusted (hopefully it should be closer to the centre of your target) and continue to adjust your windage and elevation until your are consistently hitting the centre of your target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]
#Once &quot;zeroed&quot; replace your turret caps and you are ready to go!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero Your Rifle Scope Step 10.jpg|center|550px]]

== Warnings ==

*Please wear eye protection when setting up your rifle scopes as ricochets can happen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4239">Certain rifles can be very finicky when it comes to setting your scope. Different ranges and how experienced you are with a firearm will play a role in your ability to zero your rifle in.
[[Category:Rifles]]
== Steps ==
# Find a shooting area, or range that  allows for at least {{convert|100|yd|m|adj=on|1}} shots. If you do not have a shooting range and are using property make sure you are shooting into a bank or area that stops the bullet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Shoot a Deer Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
# Find a stable place to set up the equipment. It's nice to have a shooting table of some sort that allows enough room to set a whole rifle on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Shoot a Deer Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# SAFELY load the rifle up. Keep fingers off the trigger until you are ready to fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Shoot a Deer Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]
# Once the rifle is ready and there is nobody down range, place a finger on the trigger. Finger placement on the trigger is important for consistent and accurate shooting. Make sure the trigger sits in between the tip of the finger and the first joint. Once that is done flip the safety, control breathing, and pull the trigger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Shoot a Deer Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
# After the shot has been fired check the target. If the point of impact is not visible then decrease the range you are shooting from and repeat the steps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Shoot a Deer Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]
# Before ever moving the scope's dials, make sure the scope's windage and elevation dials adjustment settings are understood. EXAMPLE: Most scopes use either a {{convert|1/2|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}} or {{convert|1/4|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}} MOA at {{convert|100|yd|m|1}}. This means that at {{convert|100|yd|m|1}}, every click while rotating the scope dials moves the cross hairs {{convert|1/2|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}} or {{convert|1/4|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}}, depending on the scopes instructions. Increasing or decreasing the distance from which you are shooting will cause the numbers to change. The closer the target is in comparison to the scopes set distance, the more the dials will have to be turned. The farther the target is in comparison to the scopes set distance, the less the dials will have to be turned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero a Rifle Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
# Some get confused with which direction to move the knobs even after knowing where the point of impact was. Some scopes are different, but almost all scopes use the technique that I will explain in this next example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero a Rifle Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
#* EXAMPLE: The targets at {{convert|100|yd|m|1}}. A scope is being used that is set for {{convert|1/2|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}} MOA at {{convert|100|yd|m|1}}. One round has been fired and it's hitting {{convert|5|in|cm|1}} low and {{convert|2|in|cm|1}} to the left. Well, according to the scope every segment rotated the scope knob is {{convert|1/2|in|cm|adj=on|1|1}} at {{convert|100|yd|m|1}}. So, look at the directional arrows on the elevation. The gun is hitting {{convert|5|in|cm|1}} low so turn the knob UP 10 clicks. Then move to the windage knob. The gun is hitting {{convert|2|in|cm|1}} to the left. So, look at your directional arrows. Turn the knob 4 clicks to the right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zero a Rifle Step 7Bullet1.jpg|center|550px]]
# Once steps 1-7 have been done, get the gun ready to fire again. Then, check the point of impact, if its good, then leave it. If it's still off then use the dials to correct again. In almost all cases the dials must be turned the way the bullet needs to come.

== Steps ==
=== Zest a Citrus Fruit with a Microplane ===
Using a microplane is the easiest way to remove the zest from an orange, lemon or lime.
#Wash your fruit under a stream of cool water.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 1.jpg}}
#Place your citrus fruit on a cutting board.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 2.jpg}}
#Position the microplane at a 45-degree angle and rest the fruit on top.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 3.jpg}}
#Push the fruit across the microplane to remove the zest.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 4.jpg}}
#Rotate the fruit as you run it across the microplane until all of the colored skin is gone. Be careful not to grate the bitter white pith.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 5.jpg}}
#Collect the grated zest and either add it to your recipe or place it in a small bowl for later use.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 6.jpg}}
#Wrap your fruit in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for another use.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 7.jpg}}
=== Zest a Citrus Fruit with a Zester ===

A zester removes the colored skin of the citrus fruit in long, curling strips. You can either leave the strips intact and use them for garnish, or you can chop the zest to add to your recipe.
#Wash your fruit under a stream of cool water.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 8.jpg}}
#Place your citrus fruit on a cutting board.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 9.jpg}}
#Position the zester on the top side of the fruit near the base of the fruit. The blades of the zester should be in contact with the zest.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 10.jpg}}
#Peel the zest from the fruit by pulling the zester toward you.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 11.jpg}}
#Rotate the fruit and continue to peel strips of zest until all of the zest has been removed. Do not remove the bitter white pith beneath.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 12.jpg}}
#Wrap the fruit in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for another use.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 13.jpg}}
#Gather the zest into a pile on your cutting board.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 14.jpg}}
#Finely chop the zest using your chef’s knife or paring knife. Alternatively, if you want to use the zest as a garnish, then leave it in long strips and don’t chop it.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 15.jpg}}
#Collect the zest and either add it to your recipe or place it in a small bowl for later use.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 16.jpg}}
=== Zest a Citrus Fruit with a Vegetable Peeler or Paring Knife ===

If you don’t own a microplane or zester, then you can carefully remove the zest from a citrus fruit using a knife or a vegetable peeler.
#Wash the citrus fruit under a stream of cool water.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 17.jpg}}
#Place the fruit on your cutting board and position your vegetable peeler or paring knife on top of the fruit near the base.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 18.jpg}}
#Peel wide strips of zest from the fruit by pulling the knife or the vegetable peeler upward.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 19.jpg}}
#Chop the zest into small pieces using your paring knife.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 20.jpg}}
#Reserve the fruit for another use.{{largeimage|Zest a Citrus Fruit Step 21.jpg}}

== Tips ==
*An orange with the zest removed can still be consumed. All citrus fruit can still be used for juicing even when the zest is removed, so do not discard fruit when the skin is gone.
*Store leftover zest in the refrigerator for two or three days in a sealed container. If you want to store zest longer, then freeze zest in single tablespoon portions. The zest will keep in the freezer for up to a year.
*If you’re using both the zest and the juice of a citrus fruit in your recipe, then be sure to zest first. After all of the juice has been removed, removing zest becomes challenging.
*If you don’t own a zester or a microplane, then you can place your citrus fruit against the fine side of a box grater and grate it to remove the zest. However, you’ll need to remove the zest slowly and gently to avoid grating off the bitter white pith.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5569">Making your own fresh zest at home is easy. Lemon zest has many uses, such as adding flavor to baked goods, serving as a garnish on certain foods or for flavoring drinks. Various common kitchen implements can be used to create zest, such as a grater, vegetable peeler, knife or microplane. The method for each implement is explained below.

[[Category:Basic Cooking Skills]]

== Ingredients ==
* Fresh lemons

== Steps ==
#Scrub and rinse the lemon well before removing the zest. Use soap and water to wash away pesticides, waxes and dyes. Allow to dry before zesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 1 Version 2.jpg}}

=== Using a Grater to Zest a Lemon ===
This zest will be fairly chunky. The zest from a grater is not as fine as zest created from a microplane.
#Position the grater above the cutting board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 2 Version 2.jpg}}
#*If you have a box grater, place it on the cutting board. 
#*If you have a flat grater, hold it at a slant, with the bottom end propped against the cutting board.
#Bear down on the lemon while moving it from the top of the grater to the bottom. Remove only the outer part of the rind, making sure to leave the pith behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 3 Version 2.jpg}}
#Turn the lemon slightly after each grating. Avoid scraping any section of the lemon more than once. Continue until you have as much zest as you need, then simply scrape or spoon up the zest from the board to collect. This type of peel is great for baking and cooking with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 4 Version 2.jpg}}

=== Using a Vegetable Peeler or Knife to Zest a Lemon ===
Zesting with a vegetable peeler or knife will give you bulky strips of lemon peel. Dice the peeled strips for a lighter zest, or use the zest as is in drinks.
#Peel the lemon from top to bottom using a vegetable peeler or knife. Apply only enough pressure to take off the top portion of the lemon's rind. Avoid peeling off the pith inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 5 Version 2.jpg}}
#Rotate the lemon after every sweep from top to bottom. Refrain from peeling a section that you have already used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 6-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 6 Version 2.jpg}}
#Continue removing the zest and pivoting the lemon until you have made a complete rotation around the lemon. This type of peel works well as a garnish on a dish or drink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 7 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 7-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 7 Version 2.jpg}}

=== Using a Microplane to Zest a Lemon ===
Using a microplane will result in a very light zest.
#Hold the microplane with the handle close to you. Have the end of the microplane set against the cutting board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 8 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 8-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 8 Version 2.jpg}}
#Grate the lemon against the microplane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 9 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 9-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 9 Version 2.jpg}}
#*Move the lemon from the handle of the microplane to its bottom edge. You may also move from the bottom of the microplane to the top. 
#*Apply gentle pressure on the lemon to remove the surface of its peel.
#*Scrape off only the rind of the lemon. Do not remove the pith.
#Spin the lemon a bit after every stroke. Refrain from using any section of the lemon more than once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 10 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 10-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 10 Version 2.jpg}}
#Continue grating and rotating until you have removed all of the zest from the lemon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest a Lemon Step 11 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest a Lemon Step 11-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest a Lemon Step 11.jpg}}


== Tips ==
* The lemon flavor in your dish will be stronger if you use finely grated zest.
* Use the zest as soon as possible after removing it, since it loses flavor with time.
* To get the best zest out of a lemon, choose a lemon with a rough, thick rind. Keeping the lemon cold will also make it easier to obtain a good zest.

== Things You'll Need ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[Image:Zest a Lime Intro.jpg|right|300px]]The zest of a lime is the outer green layer of peel, which contains fragrant and flavorful oils. Lime zest adds intense flavor to cocktails, desserts and a number of other recipes. The easiest tool for creating fine lime zest for cooking is a microplane, while long garnish strips or cocktail twists can be made with a traditional zester. However, with a little more effort and practice, either form of zest can be created with nothing more than a sharp knife or vegetable peeler.
[[Category:Citrus Fruits]]
[[Category:Food Cutting Techniques]]

== Steps ==
=== Using a microplane or fine grater ===
#Wash the lime under cool, running water. Rub the limes gently with your fingers to remove grime or waxy substances, even if there is no visible dirt on the lime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soyouwanna.com/zest-lime-zester-2935.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pat dry with a clean towel to clean the lime further and make it easier to grip.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 1.jpg}}
#Place your microplane above a cutting board at a 45-degree angle. A microplane grater is a flat or curved metal kitchen tool with tiny, sharp holes across its surface. It can be used to produce finely grated lime zest with little effort.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 2.jpg}}
#*If you have a grater with several sizes of holes, use the smallest size. It may or may not be a microplane, but can be used as a zester nonetheless.
#Gently push the lime across the surface of the microplane. Rest your lime on top of the microplane, near the base. Push the lime gently across the blades. This should shave the skin into a fine zest, which will fall onto the cutting board for you to collect.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 3.jpg}}
#*Notice that the blades are angled in one direction. Pushing the lime against the cutting edges of the blades will produce zest, while pushing it in the opposite direction will have no effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cookthink.com/reference/199/How_to_zest_a_lime&lt;/ref&gt; The cutting edges of the blades should be facing up toward the ceiling.
#*If you are using a fine grater instead of a microplane, push as gently as possible to avoid digging into the bitter, white pith beneath the skin.
#Rotate the lime to zest the rest of the fruit. Zest the first area until the colored skin has been removed. Once the white pith beneath the skin is revealed, rotate the lime to rub a new section of the colored skin over the microplane in the same way.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 4.jpg}}
#*Be careful not to remove the bitter white pith beneath the skin.
#Collect the zest and place it in a small bowl. Once the whole lime has been zested, or you have as much zest as you need, set aside the lime for later use. Use a knife to scrape the zest off the cutting board and into a small bowl, or directly into the dish you are cooking as instructed by the recipe.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 5.jpg}}
#*You don't need to spend the effort getting every last piece of zest out of the lime. The ends of the lime may be difficult to zest, for instance.
#Rinse the microplane immediately or leave it in a warm location to dry out. If you allow the zest residue to dry in the tiny holes of the microplane, it can be difficult to clean out later. Use running water to wash it out immediately, scrubbing with a thick-bristled brush. Alternatively, try using no water at all and setting the microplane near a stove or on a sunny windowsill. The heat may be enough to dry out the stuck pieces until they can be easily brushed off.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thekitchn.com/quick-tip-clean-your-zester-wi-134584&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Using a traditional zester ===
#Wash and dry the lime. Hold the lime under a stream of cool water and rub gently. Pat dry with a towel.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 7.jpg}}
#Get out your cutting board and zester. A zester is a kitchen tool with several tiny blades or sharp holes, which creates long, curling ribbons of lime zest, perfect for garnishing. Alternatively, these strips can then be chopped finely for use in cooking.
#*Some refer to this tool as a &quot;traditional zester&quot; and call microplanes &quot;microplane zesters.&quot;
#Pull the zester along the surface of the lime. If you are creating a garnish for a cocktail or dish, remove part of the white pith along with the colored zest in order to keep the curl intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-31/entertainment/8803050079_1_flavorful-zest-peel-removing&lt;/ref&gt; If you are using the zest for cooking, try to only remove thin strips of the colored zest.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 9.jpg}}
#Rotate the lime and repeat the process. Once the strips have been removed and the white pith beneath is exposed, rotate to an untouched section of the lime. Continue to pull the zester over the lime until you have the amount of zest you need for your recipe.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 10.jpg}}
#*The thickness of lime skin varies more than most citrus fruit, so it is difficult to predict how much zest is produced by one lime. If the recipe calls for &quot;zest from one lime&quot; without specifying the variety of lime, use approximately two tsp (10 mL) of zest.
#Chop the strips of zest finely (optional). If you are using the zest as a decorative garnish, skip this step. If you are using them in a recipe, use a sharp knife to cut the zest into fine pieces.

=== Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife ===
#Use this method only if you don't have other tools. When you don’t have a microplane or a zester, then a vegetable peeler or paring knife will get the job done. This process isn’t recommended if you want uniform curls or a very fine zest.
#Rinse and dry the lime. Hold the lime under running water and rub off grime with your fingers. Pat dry with a clean towel.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 11.jpg}}
#Place the lime on a cutting board and hold it with your non-dominant hand. Set a clean cutting board on a stable surface. Place the lime on top of the cutting board and hold it firmly in place near the base.
#*If you are right-handed, hold the lime with your left hand. If you are left-handed, hold it with your right hand.
#Position the vegetable peeler or paring knife. Hold the peeler or knife against the top of the lime, with the blade facing you. Do not try to point the blade away from you, as zesting this way provides less control and increases the odds of cutting yourself.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 12.jpg}}
#Methodically peel the zest from the lime. Pull the peeler or knife toward you, pressing lightly into the lime's skin. Ideally, only remove the colored zest portion of the peel, not the white pith underneath. However, press deeper into the pith if it helps keep the knife steady and controlled.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 13.jpg}}
#Trim the white pith from the zest unless using strips for garnish. Use your paring knife or any sharp, small knife to remove large pieces of white, fleshy pith from the underside of the peeled zest. This is highly recommended if using the zest in recipes, as the pith adds a bitter taste. However, if you are using the zest strips as garnish or in a cocktail, you do not need to remove the pith.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 14.jpg}}
#Chop the zest into small pieces (optional). Use the same knife to chop the zest into fine pieces. It is now ready to be added to recipes. As for the rest of the lime, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for later use.{{largeimage|Zest a Lime Step 15.jpg}}

== Tips ==
*If the lime is too soft to zest effectively, put it in the freezer for two minutes to make it firm.&lt;ref&gt;http://ideas.thenest.com/dinner-recipes/cooking-advice/articles/how-to-use-zester.aspx?MsdVisit=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*The best limes to zest are brightly colored and smell strongly when scratched. Thin-skinned limes such as key limes may be difficult to zest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/style/hfe/food/cooking101/articles/cook101_zest.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*If you dislike cleaning your microplane, you can try putting a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper between the microplane and the lime while zesting.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatscookingamerica.net/lemons.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This may simply shred the plastic or paper, however, so use only sturdy materials.
*If you’re using both the zest and the juice of a lime, zest the lime before juicing it.
*You can refrigerate limes that have had the zest removed and juice them later. Wrap them in plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.

== Steps ==
=== Using a Grater ===
#Prop the grater against a cutting board. If you are using a flat grater, hold the grater at an angle, one end resting against the cutting board. If you are using a box grater, simply place the grater on the cutting board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 1 Version 2.jpg}}
#Scrape the orange along the grater from top to bottom. Maintain enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Take off only the rind of the orange's skin, and not the white pith, which tastes bitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 2 Version 2.jpg}}
#*Make sure the orange is clean. You might not usually think to wash an orange, since you normally discard the peel, but the zest ''is'' the peel so it's important to wash off any pesticides or dirt before zesting. 
#*You might find it easier to handle the orange if you cut it in half and squeeze out the juice before zesting.
#Rotate the orange slightly after each scrape. Refrain from using any section of the orange more than once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 3 Version 2.jpg}}
#Keep turning and scraping until the top layer of peel is removed. You should now have a pile of orange zest collected on your cutting board. Scoop it into a measuring cup to see how much you have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 4 Version 2.jpg}}
#*One orange should yield about 1 tablespoon of zest. Zest more as needed to use in your recipe.
=== Using a Microplane===
#Hold the microplane at an angle. Rest the tip of the microplane against your cutting board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 5 Version 2.jpg}}
#Scrape the orange along the microplane. Lightly press the orange against the microplane and scrape it from top to bottom, or from the handle to the tip. Maintain enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Be sure to take off only the rind of the orange's skin, and not the bitter pith inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 6-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 6 Version 2.jpg}}
#Turn the orange slightly after each scrape. Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with your zest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 7 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 7-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 7 Version 2.jpg}}
#Continue scraping and turning until you have zested the entire orange. Gather your zest and measure it in a measuring cup to see how much you still need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 8 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 8-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 8 Version 2.jpg}}
=== Using a Vegetable Peeler or Knife ===
#Peel the orange as you would a potato. Hold the peeler or knife against the orange's skin. Press down hard enough so that you remove the top layer of the rind. Do not remove the pith inside the orange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 9 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 9-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 9 Version 2.jpg}}
#Spin the orange slightly after removing a section of the peel. Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with the zest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 10 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 10-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 10 Version 2.jpg}}
#Continue peeling and turning until you peeled around the circumference of the orange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zest an Orange Step 11 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zest an Orange Step 11-preview Version 2.jpg|Zest an Orange Step 11 Version 2.jpg}}
#Chop the peel into small pieces. Using a knife or peeler to peel an orange results in large pieces that need to be chopped up so you can use them as zest. Use a sharp knife to chop the peeled pieces finely. Measure out the amount you need for your recipe.


== Tips ==
* If sealed in a plastic bag, orange zest will keep in the freezer for up to six months.
* The smaller and more finely grated the zest, the more the orange flavor will soak into your recipes.
* Zesting with a grater will give you a zest that is slightly coarser than a microplane.
* Using a microplane will give you a very fine zest.
* Wash the orange thoroughly before zesting. Use soap and water to remove pesticides, waxes and dyes.
* Using a vegetable peeler or knife will leave you with larger strips of zest. You can use this type of zest in drinks. You may also dice it to get a finer zest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">You can zip several files together to create one compressed file. Zipping files allows you to save hard drive space, send files more quickly over the Internet, and to attach certain file types (such as .exe) to emails. In Windows XP, Vista, and 7 you can either select each file and send them to a compressed folder or create a compressed folder and drag files to it. With Mac OS X, you use the &quot;Compress&quot; option with multiple files selected. The guide below describes each of these methods.


[[Category:File Manipulation]]

== Steps ==

=== Zipping Files Together Using Windows Explorer ===
#Select all the files you want to zip. You can hold down the Control (CTRL) key and select each file individually or hold down the Shift key and select the first and last file in a consecutive list of files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 1 Version 3.jpg}}
#Right-click on one of the files and point to &quot;Send To.&quot; The file you choose to click on typically determines the name of the zip file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 2 Version 3.jpg}}
#Click on &quot;Compressed (zipped) Folder.&quot; This creates the zip file, with compressed copies of your selected files inside it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 3 Version 3.jpg}}
#* You can rename the new zip folder to something more memorable. Either click (to select the file), pause, then click on the name below the file or right-click the file and select &quot;Rename&quot; from the submenu. The new name will automatically save when you hit Enter or click away from the file.
=== Zipping Files Together Using Drag and Drop ===
#Right-click any empty space on the desktop. Select &quot;New&quot; from the submenu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 4 Version 3.jpg}}
#Choose &quot;Compressed (zipped) File&quot; from the menu. A zipped folder will appear on the desktop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 5 Version 3.jpg}}
#Move or copy all of your selected files into the compressed folder. The files will automatically be compressed as they are transferred into the new folder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 6-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 6 Version 3.jpg}}
=== Zipping Files Together in  Mac OS X ===
#Select the items you wish to zip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 7.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 7-preview.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 7 Version 3.jpg}}
#Select &quot;Compress&quot; in the &quot;File&quot; menu. When you compress multiple files together, a single new compressed file appears with the default name &quot;Archive.zip.&quot; You can rename the file to something more memorable and personalized, as long as the .zip extension remains at the end of it. Either click on the  file, pause, then click again or click on the file and hit Return to edit the name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip Files Together Step 8.360p.mp4|Zip Files Together Step 8-preview.jpg|Zip Files Together Step 8 Version 3.jpg}}


== Video ==
{{Video:Zip Files Together|}}

== Tips ==
* Some file types are initially compressed. File types that come compressed include .rar, .tgz, .cab, .gz, and .mme. The size of these files will not be reduced if you manually compress them, as their size is already relatively small.
* You can also use third-party zipping software to zip files together, though most modern iterations of Windows (XP, Vista, 7) and Mac OS X have native zipping functionality.

== Warnings ==
* Adding encrypted files to a compressed folder will cause them to be unencrypted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1845">Let's say you have a bunch of .img files and you want to send them to your friend via email. Files of that type as well as videos are already in compressed form. You know compression won't make them smaller but it's still easier to send them as one archive than sending all images one by one. Any solution? Yes. Zip them without compression with B1 Free Archiver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">The Android platform is rather convenient in comparison with some other popular portable devices operating systems in terms of file management, data storage and media share. What makes it even easier is the usage of good old archives. Archiving applications compress your files and folders, reduce their size and help you keep things organized. You will often find yourself in need of sending or storing a bunch of work documentation, study materials or personal photos, and it will be done much easier if those files are compressed.
[[Category:Ringtones and Other Downloads]]

== Steps ==
#Download [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.b1.android.archiver&amp;hl=en B1 Free Archiver]. It is available for free on Google Play Market. Install and run it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip Files on Android Using B1 Zip Archiver Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Go to files. This application functions as a file manager, so you can freely navigate through your folders. Once you are inside the folder with files you wish to compress, press the zipper icon at the top right corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip Files on Android Using B1 Zip Archiver Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Select files. Choose file(s)/folder(s) you wish to compress, then tap “Create Archive” button.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip Files on Android Using B1 Zip Archiver Step 3 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Select archive format. You can choose between ZIP and B1 formats (the latter actually has a great compression ratio). Then enter the name for your new archive. If you wish to set a password for your archive check the Protect with password option and enter the desired password. Hit the OK button once you’re ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip Files on Android Using B1 Zip Archiver Step 4 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
*If you want to compress an individual file/folder - long tap and select Compress from the menu. This menu will also allow you to move, rename, delete files, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4969">Compressing, or zipping, a file is the process of creating smaller versions of large files. Zipping a file has several major benefits, such as saving storage space on your computer and making it easier to send large files through email. Depending on your email client, you may have limited storage space or it may take several minutes for an email with a large file attachment to complete the sending and receiving process. You can also create zipped folders that will automatically zip any files that you place into the folder. Computers with Windows XP have the option to zip files and folders easily, since this feature is built into their operating systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4250">{{fa}}If you have a lot of old documents and files taking up space on your computer, you can compress them into an archive to save space. Mac OS X allows you to compress files directly from the operating system. You can also download third-party compression software that may be more effective. Follow this guide to compress your old files.
[[Category:Mac]]
== Steps ==
===Use the Finder===
#Open Finder. You can open Finder by clicking the Finder icon on the Dock. It looks like a square blue face. Once the Finder opens, navigate to the files that you want to compress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#*To easily compress multiple files from various locations into one .zip file, first create a new folder. Copy all of the files that you want to compress into this folder.
#Select your files. You can select individual files out of a list by holding the Command button and clicking on each file. Once you have the files you want selected, right-click one of the selected files. If your mouse only has one button, hold Ctrl and click the file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#*If you want to compress a folder containing multiple files, right-click the folder.
#Compress the files. Select Compress from the right-click menu. Wait for the process to complete. Depending on how many files you are compressing, this could take several minutes. The filename will be the same as the file or folder that you selected to compress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 3 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#*Compressing multiple files or folders will create a file named Archive.zip.
#*Compressed files will be about 10% smaller than the original. This will vary depending on what is being compressed.
===Use a Third-Party Program===
#Find a compression program. There are several options available online for both free or purchase. Some compression formats, such as .rar, require proprietary software to create the archive. Others, such as .zip, can be made by nearly every compression program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#*Other proprietary compression methods may compress your files smaller than the standard .zip compression available through Mac OS X.
#Add your files. Once you’ve installed and opened your compression program, add the files and folders that you’d like to compress. The method varies from program to program, but you can often just drag and drop your files into the compression window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]
#Secure your file. Many compressions allow you to add a password to your compressed file. Check the Security section, or click the File Menu and select Add Password or Encrypt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a File on a Mac Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
=== Zipping one file using the Terminal ===
#[[Get to the Command Line on a Mac|Open the Terminal]].
#Type {{kbd|cd}}, press spacebar, and drag in the folder that you want the resulting zip file to end up in. Press {{keypress|return}}.
#Type {{kbd|zip}} and then drag in the file or folder you want to zip. Press {{keypress|return}}.

=== Zipping multiple files using the Terminal ===
#[[Get to the Command Line on a Mac|Open the Terminal]].
#Type {{kbd|cd}}, press spacebar, and drag in the folder that files you want to zip are in. Press {{keypress|return}}.
#Type {{kbd|mkdir zip}}. Press {{keypress|return}}.
#Type {{kbd|cp file1 zip}}, replacing {{kbd|file1}} with the name of the file, including the file extension. Press {{keypress|return}}. Repeat for each file. 
#* If there is a space in the filename, type it like this: {{kbd|cp file\ 1 zip}}. Make sure to use a backslash, not a forward slash.
#When you have finished, type {{kbd|ls zip}} and press {{keypress|return}}. Check to see that every file you want to zip is there.
#Type {{kbd|zip -r zip zip}} and press {{keypress|return}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">Compressing, or &quot;zipping,&quot; files on a computer allows you to send and save them in smaller file sizes. It is especially useful when sending media, like photos and videos. You can learn how to zip a folder on Mac or Windows operating systems (OS). Start zipping files on your computer.
[[Category:Basic Computer Skills]]

== Steps ==

===  Zipping Files on Windows OS ===
#Place the file you want to zip in a place where you have easy access. You may want to use the &quot;desktop&quot; or a folder in the &quot;documents&quot; section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 1 Version 2.jpg}}
#Consider creating and zipping a new folder, if you want to compress multiple files. This will save space and work if you are planning to send files over email. It will also allow you to keep files together so you don't lose them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 2.jpg}}
#* Create a new folder on your desktop or in a documents folder by pressing your right mouse button. Select &quot;New Folder&quot; and name it according to your file type or project. Creating and zipping a folder is also useful for data storage, email inbox storage and email transmission times.
#Select the item that you would like to compress. You will usually use a mouse to do this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 3 Version 2.jpg}}
#Hold down the right button on the mouse. A list of options will pop up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 4 Version 2.jpg}}
#* If you don't have a right mouse button, hold down &quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;F10&quot; to get the same list of options.
#Choose the &quot;Send To&quot; option in the list of right-click options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 5 Version 2.jpg}}
#Move your cursor right, into the list of &quot;Send To&quot; options. Choose &quot;Compressed Folder.&quot; Wait while the folder compresses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 6-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 6 Version 2.jpg}}
#Look for a new icon in the folder. It should say the previous folder's name and a &quot;.zip&quot; file extension name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 7 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 7-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 7 Version 2.jpg}}
#Attach this file to an email, place it on a hard drive or simply keep it in the folder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zip a Folder Step 8 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zip a Folder Step 8-preview Version 2.jpg|Zip a Folder Step 8 Version 2.jpg}}
#* A person who receives a .zip file must double click on the folder to unzip the file. After completing this, they will be able to access all of the files in the original folder.
===  Zipping Files in Mac OS ===
# Create a new folder on your desktop or in a documents folder.
# Name the folder according to the project or file subject.
# Add the files you want to compress to that folder.
# Select the folder using your mouse or track pad.
# Right click on the folder. Scroll down and click on the option &quot;Compress Folder Name.&quot;
#* If you do not have a mouse with a right mouse button, press the &quot;Control&quot; button and the track pad bar at once. Scroll down with your track pad and click on the &quot;Compress&quot; option.
# Wait for the folder to be compressed. Then, send or store the zipped file. Anyone who receives the file will need to double click on the .zip file to unzip and use it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">A Photoshop Deluxe ([[Make a PSD File Using Photoshop (Beginner)|PSD]]) file is an image file that is capable of having multiple layers. Originally developed for the Adobe Photoshop software, the PSD format is now also used by many other programs with multi-layer image editing capabilities. You can use a compression utility called [[Unzip a File or Folder With Winzip|WinZip]] to zip a PSD file into a [[Open a .Zip File Without Winzip|compressed format]].
[[Category:File Manipulation]]
== Steps ==
# Visit the WinZip website to download and install the WinZip compression utility on your computer system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Open the Start menu using the green button at the bottom-left of your screen and select &quot;My Computer.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Use the Windows Explorer window that opens up to go to the folder where&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 3 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Accept the WinZip terms of service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 4 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Create a new zip project by pressing the &quot;New&quot; button at the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 5 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Pick the location where you want to save the zipped PSD file and assign a name for the new file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 6 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Hit the &quot;OK&quot; button. This will take you to the &quot;Add&quot; window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
# Use the file browser to find and select the PSD file that you want to zip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 8.jpg|center|550px]]
# Zip the file by pressing the &quot;Add&quot; button. The zipped PSD file will appear in the folder that you had chosen with the filename that you had assigned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PSD File Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
*Many computers that are sold with the Windows operating system already have WinZip preinstalled by the manufacturer, so you may not have to download and install it yourself.
*When you zip a PSD file its size becomes smaller. This makes it easier to share the file online or reduce the storage space required to save the file on your hard drive. You can use WinZip to decompress the file into its original size and PSD format later on.
*WinZip is not just for compressing Photoshop Deluxe files. It can be used to compress many other file formats.

== Warnings ==
*If you are using a version of Windows that was released before Windows XP you may have to open WinZip manually instead of using the &quot;Add to Zip file&quot; shortcut through Windows Explorer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">A PowerPoint file can be compressed, or zipped, if the file size becomes too large to store on your computer or to send through email. In some cases, PowerPoint files can become large as a result of including multiple images or images with large pixel sizes in your presentation. In addition to zipping a PowerPoint file itself, there are also steps you can take to compress the images within your presentation.


[[Category:PowerPoint Presentations]]

== Steps ==

=== Zip a PowerPoint File in Windows 7, XP, or Vista ===
# Navigate to the PowerPoint file that you need to zip, right-click it, place your cursor over &quot;Send To&quot; and select &quot;Compressed (zipped) Folder&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# A new window will appear and you need to click &quot;Yes&quot; to continue with the compression. This procedure will create a zipped version of your PowerPoint file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#* If you want to rename the zipped PowerPoint file, right-click on it, select &quot;Rename,&quot; and type in a new name for the zipped file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 2Bullet1.jpg|center|550px]]
=== Compress Images in PowerPoint 2002 and Later Versions ===
# Open your PowerPoint presentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
# Navigate to a slide in your presentation where an image is present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
# Place your cursor over the image and right-click your mouse or just click the image (later versions of Power Point).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]
# Select &quot;Format Picture&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
# Click directly on the &quot;Picture&quot; tab and when the Format dialog box appears on your screen select &quot;Compress&quot;, or just click &quot;Compress Pictures&quot; (later versions of Power Point).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
# You can uncheck the box next to &quot;Apply only to this picture&quot; to apply the procedure to all pictures in the presentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 8.jpg|center|550px]]
# Select an option under the &quot;Change resolution&quot; section or &quot;Target Output&quot; (later versions of Power Point): choose the &quot;Web and Screen&quot; option if you plan on showing your PowerPoint presentation on a screen, choose the &quot;Print&quot; option if you are going to present the PowerPoint by distributing it on pieces of paper or choose E-mail option if you want to share your presentation. Also be sure that the box next to &quot;Delete cropped areas of pictures&quot; is checked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]
# Click on the &quot;OK&quot; button to save your changes and compress your images.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip a PowerPoint File Step 10.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
* Since a common pixel resolution for computer screens is 1024 by 768, you may need to compress any images larger than this in your PowerPoint presentation to reduce the size of your file. To view the pixel resolution of your computer screen, right-click anywhere on your desktop, select &quot;Properties,&quot; and click on the &quot;Settings&quot; tab. Your resolution will be provided in the Screen Resolution section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) files are usually quite small in size because they are already compressed to remove any sounds that would not be audible on a noticeable level to the human ear. However, on certain occasions you may want to compress an MP3 further into Zip format, especially if you have a long song or speech that can make the size of the MP3 quite large. The most popular program you can use to zip an MP3 file is WinZip, a file compression utility developed by Microsoft.
[[Category:File Manipulation]]

== Steps ==
#  Download the WinZip utility from the official WinZip website and install it on your computer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 1 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Go to &quot;My Computer&quot; from the Start menu to open Windows Explorer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 2 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Browse to the folder containing the MP3 file that you want to zip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 3 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Right-click on the MP3 file's name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 4 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Mouse-over &quot;Zip Program&quot; or &quot;Send to&quot; in the pop-up menu (you should see 1 of the 2 options depending on which version of Windows you are using).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 5 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Click on &quot;Add to Zip file.&quot; The MP3 will be zipped and the new zipped file will be added in the same folder containing the original MP3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 6 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
=== Compressing Through WinZip ===
#  Run the WinZip utility by selecting it from the Programs list in the Start menu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 7 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Agree to the terms and conditions if prompted to do so at startup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 8 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Press the &quot;New&quot; button in the top-left corner. This will pop up the &quot;New Archive&quot; window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 9 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Use the file browser box to select the folder where you want to store the zipped file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 10 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Type the name you want to give to the new file in the &quot;File Name&quot; textbox.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 11 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Press the &quot;OK&quot; button. The &quot;Add&quot; window will appear automatically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 12 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Select the MP3 file that you want to compress. You can go to the file and select it using the file browser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 13 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Press the &quot;Add&quot; button. The MP3 file that you had selected will be zipped and the new zipped file will be saved in the folder that you had assigned in the New Archive window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 14 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Close WinZip after you are done using it by clicking on the cross sign in the top-right corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip an MP3 File Step 15 Version 2.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
* WinZip may already be preinstalled in some computers.
* Other utility programs that you can use to zip an MP3 file include PentaZip, PowerArchiver and PKZip. Their method of use for converting files to Zip format is very similar to that of WinZip.
* Select multiple files at once in the file browser by pressing down the Control (Ctrl) key on your keyboard and clicking on all the files that you want to select.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">Zip is a common compressed archive file format: an archive file is meant to combine multiple files together for easier management i.e. backup, sharing through mail or cloud or any other network service, etc. File compression basically uses statistical models to map the original data to a smaller output, which allows both to spare storage for backup and save upload and download bandwidth (and time) for sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, various archive file types emerged, introducing unique features to distinguish them from competitors, as stronger compression ratio, ability to split the output archive to met some constrains (i.e. mail attachment limit), error detection and correction, and encryption in order to enforce privacy if the file is stolen, or passed through public or third party controlled channels, i.e. mail server, or remote storage service. This brought users more choice and more features, but also the need for dedicated archive manager applications to fully use the potential of different file formats, either for creating own archives, and for extracting archives received or downloaded.
[[Category:Software]]

== Steps ==
#  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; PeaZip is a freeware cross-platform archive manager that provides a single GUI for Open Source technologies ([[Archive Using 7zip|7-Zip]], FreeArc, PAQ, UPX...) on Windows, Linux, and BSD. The file manager allows both to select files and folders to be archived as Zip files (or other formats), and to select archives to be unzipped. Alternatively, file selection can be performed with PeaZip system's context menu entries (not featured in PeaZip Portable version) or simply dragging and dropping files from / to the program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip and Unzip Files with Peazip Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
#  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Archive creation can be started dragging files on the application, or with &quot;Add&quot; button in program's tool bar. The archive creation interface prompts by default creation of a Zip file, but the file format can be customized, as well as compression ratio (from faster to better) and other miscellaneous options, including encryption. PeaZip relies on optimized Deflate algorithm for compressing in Zip format, that usually compress 5-10% better than standard Deflate but keeping compatibility with other Zip utilities. 7Z format gives better compression ratio, but is slower than Zip. As quite unique feature for archive management software, PeaZip supports two factor authentication (password plus key file), random password generation, and features an integrated encrypted password manager. &quot;Advanced&quot; tab features more fine-grained options, &quot;Console&quot; tab transform the task in a command line i.e. for use in scripts or for study purpose, &quot;Schedule&quot; tab allows to transform the interactive task in a scheduled one, i.e. for setting up a backup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip and Unzip Files with Peazip Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Archive extraction can be started from system context menu, or dragging compressed files on the application, or with &quot;Extract&quot; button in program's tool bar. It can handle multiple archives even of mixed types at once, or selective extraction of content from a single archive. Over 170 types of archives are supported: classic ZIP files and its variants, new WinZip's ZIPX file format, RAR files, old ACE archives, Microsoft's CAB and WIM files, Apple's DMG packages, ISO and UDF disk images, and many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zip and Unzip Files with Peazip Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
*PeaZip Portable is available for all supported platforms, and does not require installation. It is useful to be deployed on a removable media or over a network, or when lacking of rights for installing software on the target machine
*The software features secure deletion to permanently remove files and archives after the use
*As an option, history of recently viewed directories and archives can be deleted and turned off

== Warnings ==
*Zip format can be read by any archive manager utility, and most systems (i.e. Windows XP and newer) features basic tools for Unzip. Using archive formats different than Zip may bring various additional features resulting in several benefits, but the receiver of the file may lack the tools to handle it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">This is like meditation or hypnosis in a sense, except you can do this comfortably for large amounts of time without suffering from boredom. This is a good way to relax while coming up with constructive ideas. Leave zoning out for when you have free time; it isn't something to practice during work or school hours.
[[Category:Relaxation Techniques]]
== Steps ==
#Stop conversations with other people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zone Out Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Close your eyes if you want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zone Out Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#  Sit or lie down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zone Out Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
#Pick a thought that is calming or something that requires quite a bit of thinking, but is not stressful. For example, how you are going to plan your garden, or going to the beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zone Out Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#Start thinking about it and keep thinking. Keep your muscles relaxed - being tense can hinder the progress.
#Vision leads to imagination. If you are trying to zone out per-say in a really boring meeting, find one, JUST ONE, object and STARE at it, (Coffee mug, pencil, window) don't move or think about anything in particular, just...stare.
#Lose your focus. Other than blinking, don't move your eyes, if you really want to be &quot;inside your imagination,&quot; allow your vision to lose focus.
# Pin-pointed vision. There are people that can realize they are zoning out, while doing so, when their vision is coming to a pin-point, all is black except for that little pin-point. If you even think about moving your eyes, the pin-point widens and you regain your full vision again.

== Tips ==
*Where you are can affect this. For example, it would be hard to do this at a crowded birthday party.
*Use music only if it works for you; some people find it helps them zone out, but others end up focusing on the lyrics or beats.
*You will be able to tell when you have zoned out because your surroundings seem to go into the background and you are living in your thoughts The best way I can describe it is like when you are in a dream and you can influence it you just feel relaxed and at peace with everything. If you feel your self slipping off to sleep don't stop it for me that's saying you are now relaxed.
*It may not be a good idea to disconnect from your surroundings, but this can be very calming.

== Warnings ==
*Never zone out when driving or operating dangerous machinery, or if your attention is needed.
*Zoning out is not a good idea in a class where your teacher may notice or you need to take notes or do work.
*If you are really disconnected from your surroundings you may be at risk of being embarrassed when you are &quot;awakened.&quot;
*Don't zone out at work.
*Try not to stare at one spot for too long. You may notice that subject begin to &quot;smoke&quot;.

== Things You'll Need ==
*A mind
*A few good ideas to think about.
*A place where you can have privacy and be alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">Ok, so you have this really boring teacher, and she always brings you into the hall, or gets mad, and lectures you, and stuff. Are you tired of it? Well, here's a perfect solution! This can be used with bosses, or teachers, or even parents and principals!
[[Category:Dealing with Teachers]]

== Steps ==
#Listen for key words. If your teacher has words he or she frequently uses, like, &quot;Got it?!&quot; or &quot;Understand?!&quot; This is good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Accept Your Boyfriend's Friends Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
#Wait for words that expect a response (Like &quot;ok?&quot;) and say, &quot;Yes madam, or &quot;Ok Sir&quot;. But be careful, your teacher might be saying &quot;Do you think that's okay?&quot; and you would be caught, so do this carefully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Avoid Being Noticed in School Step 9.jpg|center|550px]]
#Think about a song you like in your &quot;subconscious&quot;, and allow your mind to wander into other thoughts. Just keep listening for those words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Be a Good Friend (for Girls) Step 12.jpg|center|550px]]
#If your teacher yells at you, &quot;ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?!!?&quot; and wakes you up, so to speak, just say &quot;yes, I didn't think I was supposed to answer, like a rhetorical question...Sorry.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Avoid Being Noticed in School Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
#Try to go into a self-induced trance, and turn all sound that goes through the state of mind your in, sub, or logical, into vision, like colours, it’s called synesthesia, and it's hard to self-induce. But it's awesome!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Be a Good Friend (for Girls) Step 14.jpg|center|550px]]
#Make sure you are still using about 12-17% brainpower of the state you're in, to stay in touch with the real world, to keep the other half of your mind listening. Think of it as waking up to an alarm clock, but not a pet jumping on to your bed to cuddle...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Avoid Getting Detentions Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]
#Don't get too cocky, check in on the real world every so often, and see if the conversation was headed where you thought, so you can answer at least some of the questions your teacher might ask at the end of what to you was a &quot;great talk&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Survive In a Boarding School Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
#Try this short periods at a time a then start to go longer periods when you think you have got the hang of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Accept Your Boyfriend's Friends Step 5.jpg|center|550px]]


== Tips ==
*Don't stare at her/him. They'll notice your tactics.
*Another tactic is mind-rambling. You think of one topic, and then you go off on another tangent, until you think of two things that seem to have no relation at all, except for the tangent your twisted, sadistic mind came up with.
*Don't say &quot;Wait, what were you saying?&quot; After they ask you something, they will probably get angry that you were not listening.

== Warnings ==
*Don't let your eyes droop, and don't fall asleep, try and think of things that are somewhat interesting, to keep you awake.
*Keep zoning out, and you might miss something very important like, '''There is no school tomorrow'''
*Don't let them catch you, know what they say, and consider all the possibilities. You don't want to look out only for a select few things because your teacher might say something important and you'll miss it.
*Do not try this if you might get fired!

== Things You'll Need ==
*A friend to practice the activities described above.
*A multi-tasking ability

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">One of the most powerful features of an iOS device like an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad is the ability to zoom into things like maps, photos and web pages. This handy guide helps explain the basics behind bringing out enhanced detail on your touch screen device.
[[Category:IPod Touch]]
[[Category:IPhone]]
== Steps ==
#While using a zoom-friendly application (more common instances are web pages, email messages and photos), place your thumb and pointer finger at opposing points of the screen as if preparing to pinch a cheek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom In or Out on an iPhone or iPod Touch Step 1 Version 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#Gently move your fingers away from each other. Note that the speed at which your fingers are spread will influence the rate of zoom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom In or Out on an iPhone or iPod Touch Step 2 Version 4.jpg|center|550px]]
#To zoom back out, reverse the motion and gently &quot;pinch&quot; your fingers towards each other while keeping contact with the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom In or Out on an iPhone or iPod Touch Step 3 Version 4.jpg|center|550px]]

== Tips ==
*An alternate method is to simply double-tap on an image or object you would like to zoom into or out of. Though the zoom distance is pre-set, this can often be a handy shortcut for quickly glancing at something in detail, and can sometimes be repeated to zoom deeper into high-detail objects like maps.
*Though this guide applies specifically to iOS devices, the action will work on nearly any modern multi-touch screen.
*It can help to use your fingernail and fingertip to add precision and avoid obscuring details of what you'd like to zoom in on.
*While zoomed in, some applications will allow you to rotate an object (a map or a picture, for instance) by simply &quot;rotating&quot; your fingers around the same center point you were zooming in an out from.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2958">[[Zoom in on a PC|Zooming in]] and out on a PC is very simple. Here are several methods to do so!
[[Category:Windows]]

== Steps ==
===In a Browser===
#In any browser, you can go to View &gt;&gt; Zoom Out to de-magnify what's present on the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 1.jpg}}
===Using the Ctrl Key===
#Press and hold the ctrl key; then scroll down with your mouse's scroll wheel or laptop's trackpad to zoom out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 2 Version 2.jpg}}
#Alternatively, press and hold the ctrl key, then press - to zoom out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 3 Version 2.jpg}}
#Press ctrl and then the &quot;0&quot; (zero) key to return the screen to its original/normal magnification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 4.jpg}}
===Using Magnifier===
#PCs have an accessibility tool called Magnifier that you can hold over parts of the screen for readability and ease of usage. You can set the zoom setting to be lower than 100% to set up a De-Magnifier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 5.jpg}}
#Launch the tool by going to Start &gt;&gt; Programs &gt;&gt; Accessories &gt;&gt; Accessibility &gt;&gt; Magnifier. Click on the magnifying class icon to manage its settings, and set the zoom level to a number lower than 100%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom Out on a PC Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom Out on a PC Step 6-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom Out on a PC Step 6.jpg}}
#*Setting Magnifier to &quot;Full Screen&quot; mode magnifies your entire screen.
#*Setting Magnifier to &quot;Lens&quot; mode creates an magnified area that follows your mouse pointer, much like a real magnifying glass.
#*In that menu, there is also an option to turn off the Magnifier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">Internet accessibility is important even if you are not suffering a visual impairment. Web pages should be designed with this in mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3870">IMovie allows users to use a zoom feature with any photo, still frame video shot, or video clip that has been imported into your iMovie project. The act of zooming in and out and panning back and forth over a photo, still frame video shot, or video is called the &quot;Ken Burns Effect&quot; and is how the effect buttons are designated within the iMovie program. Ken Burns is a noted film documentarian that developed this particular zoom and pan technique.
[[Category:IMovie]]

== Steps ==
# Open your iMovie program and select the iMovie project  you wish to add the zoom effect to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 1.jpg|center|550px]]
# Click on the video clip you are applying the zoom effect to within the event browser window in the upper middle portion of the iMovie project screen. This will make the selected clip show up in the window to the right of the video clip event browser. Verify you have selected the appropriate video clip to apply the zoom effect to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 2.jpg|center|550px]]
# Click on the &quot;Crop&quot; button located on the middle pane separating the top project workspace from the bottom. This button is designated by a square with the 2 lines of the square that create the corners overlapping each other. This button will bring up &quot;Fit,&quot; &quot;Crop,&quot; and &quot;Ken Burns&quot; video editing effects onto the selected video clip within the editing viewer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 3.jpg|center|550px]]
# Select the &quot;Ken Burns&quot; button located at the upper middle portion of the video editing screen. This will bring up a green rectangle and a red rectangle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 4.jpg|center|550px]]
# Place the rectangles according to where you want the zoom effect to begin and where you want the effect to end.
#* Place the green rectangle over the image area you want the effect to zoom in on when the clip starts; place the red rectangle over the area you want the zoom effect to end on. For example, the green rectangle can be focused on a smaller area, which will create a zoomed in effect, and the red rectangle can be placed in a larger aspect of the clip to zoom out. You can move these rectangles around by clicking and dragging each around to the specific spot you need the zoom effect to take place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 5Bullet1.jpg|center|550px]]
#* Also, resize the rectangles accordingly by dragging the corners of each rectangle back and forth, resizing the image area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 5Bullet2.jpg|center|550px]]
#* Selecting the double arrow button at the bottom of the video editing screen will make the green and red rectangles swap positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 5Bullet3.jpg|center|550px]]
# Preview the Ken Burns effect you have just created by clicking on the &quot;Play&quot; button in the video viewer/editor window. This button is designated by the play symbol (sideways triangle). Adjust the rectangles to get the effect exactly how you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 6.jpg|center|550px]]
# Click on the &quot;Done&quot; button once you have modified the effect to its desired position to apply the effects you have just created.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom iMovie Step 7.jpg|center|550px]]

{{Video:Zoom iMovie|}}

== Tips ==
*In older versions of the iMovie program, the Ken Burns effect is only applicable to still frame video and photos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5699">The Internet Explorer zoom function is a relatively new introduction to the web browser. Internet Explorer 5 allowed rudimentary text zoom, but not entire page zoom. Internet Explorer 6 didn’t have built-in page zoom, although you could download plug-ins that would allow you to zoom images. With Internet Explorer 7 and 8 the zoom function became much more robust. You can now zoom text as well as the entire page by following a few simple steps.

== Steps ==
===Adjust Text Size in IE===
#Open up Internet Explorer 7 or 8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 1.360p.mp4|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 1-preview.jpg|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 1.jpg}}

#Choose among the following default zoom levels to zoom to more precise measurements: 400%, 200%, 150%, 125%, 100%, 75% and 50%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 8.360p.mp4|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 8-preview.jpg|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 8.jpg}}
#Set a custom zoom level by clicking on Custom… and inputting your desired zoom percentage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 9.360p.mp4|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 9-preview.jpg|Zoom in Internet Explorer Step 9.jpg}}

#Click on the Advanced tab, and look under the Accessibility section.

== Tips ==
*If your mouse has a wheel, you can hold down CTRL and spin the wheel up to zoom in, and spin the wheel down to zoom out.
*You can hit CTRL + to zoom in or CTRL – to zoom out.
*Hitting CTRL 0 resets the zoom level to 100%.
*There were some changes to the zoom functionality in Internet Explorer 8. Zooming in Internet Explorer 7 allowed text to overflow off of the screen, and required you to manipulate a horizontal toolbar to view all the information on a web page. In Internet Explorer 8, the text is wrapped and the horizontal toolbar is no longer needed, making for a more user-friendly zooming experience. Internet Explorer also scales elements within the web page, rather than simply magnifying them. For this reason, the zoom feature in Internet Explorer 8 is now called Adaptive Zoom.

== Warnings ==
*One commonly experienced problem among IE 7 and 8 users is new web pages that are opened at a strange zoom level, like 200%. To fix this problem, refer to Step 3. Ensure that the box labeled Reset Zoom Level for New Windows and Tabs is checked. This will force all new web pages to open at the standard zoom level of 100%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">Minecraft is a game where you can build your own world using Lego style blocks and tools. In order to zoom in or out while playing, you will need to use a Minecraft mod. A mod - or modification - allows you to change the original game content in order to manipulate what you need. Zooming in Minecraft isn’t a native feature, and therefore will need to enable mods.

# Click &quot;Options.&quot; Locate the &quot;Options…&quot; button to the right of the Zoom activation buttons. This will let you fine-tune your zooming controls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 4.png|center|550px]]
#* Maximum Zoom: when you press the zoom-in keyboard shortcut (Command-option-equals), your screen will zoom to the magnification you set here. You can set the zoom anywhere from 1.1x the current screen size, to 20x the current screen size! 
#* Minimum Zoom: when you press the zoom-out keyboard shortcut (Command-option-minus), the screen will only zoom out to this preset level.
#** In either case, continuing to hold down the keyboard shortcut will continue zooming in or out to the maximum levels.
#* Show preview rectangle when zoomed out: To see what part of  your screen will be magnified, enable this. It will show as a black rectangle on your screen.
#* Smooth images: check this to add a smoothing function to the zoomed-in screen. While it improves the look of zoomed-in images, it can make text appear a little blurry.
#* Zoom follows keyboard focus: when you are zoomed in, and type something that goes beyond the boundaries of the zoomed area, the screen will track your cursor so your text will always be displayed.
#* Continuously with pointer: when zoomed in, the screen moves continuously as you move your cursor.
#* Only when the pointer reaches an edge: your screen stays put until your cursor reaches the edge of the screen.
#* So the pointer is at or near the center of the image: this keeps your cursor in the center of the screen, and only the screen moves.
#* If your mouse features a scroll wheel, you can hold down the modifier keys and scroll. Rather than a quick zoom in and out to the preset maximum and minimum levels, using the scroll wheel provides a smooth, slow zoom in and back out. Set the modifier keys by clicking in the field, then pressing your preferred modifier keys.
#* When you've finished setting the options, click the &quot;Done&quot; button.

===  Zooming in a Window ===
# Zoom in a window. Click this checkbox, and rather than zooming your entire screen, a &quot;magnifying glass&quot; enlarges everything underneath it. Like zooming the screen, you can adjust the level of zoom with Control-Option-Equals or Minus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Zoom in on a Mac Step 5.png|center|550px]]
# Click on Options. Like regular zoom, zooming in a window has a set of options, as shown in the image below. 
#* Magnification: sets the zoom level when you activate Zoom in Window (Command-Option-8).
#* Stationary: when the window position is set to &quot;Stationary,&quot; the zoom window shows in the center of the monitor, and the cursor location determines what appears under the window.
#* Follow mouse cursor: the window remains under your cursor, and can be dragged anywhere. This is similar to the way a real magnifying glass works.
#* Tiled along edge: sets the zoom area to be a full-length column on the left side of your monitor, displaying zoomed content that tracks your cursor.
#* Invert colors turns white to black, black to white, and green to purple. 
#* Smooth images: smoothes the edges of both text and images.
#* Zoom follows keyboard focus: when you are zoomed in, and type something that goes beyond the boundaries of the zoom window, the cursor stays centered in the window while the magnified parts track your keyboard focus—usually your cursor or entry field.
#* Enable temporary zoom: holding down Control-option keys will pop up a zoomed window that is active as long as you hold down the modifier keys. When you let go, the window disappears.
#* Speak items under mouse after delay: will read whatever text is below your cursor. You can set the time delay from &quot;Normal,&quot; which is instantaneous, to &quot;Maximum,&quot; which is about five seconds.
#* Enable &quot;Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom&quot; to give mouse control to your zooming. To set the hot keys, press and hold the desired key or keys. Allowed keys are Shift, Control, Command, and Option, only.
#* Adjust Size and Location: Press this button to resize and set the default position for whatever window you've chosen to display.&lt;ref&gt;Apple Help Center&lt;/ref&gt;
===  View Option ===
#  Go to the menu bar at the top of your computer screen. [[Image:Screen Shot 2014 02 23 at 1.57.40 PM.png|right|181px]]
#  Click Zoom in from the drop-down menu. [[Image:Screen Shot 2014 02 23 at 1.59.33 PM.png|right|181px]]
#*Do this as many times as you need to get a bigger browser.

== Tips ==
* Become familiar with the hot key combinations—even if you're not visually impaired, being able to zoom in on something quickly is a very handy feature, whether you just need a closeup, or are showing somebody something from across the room.

[[Category:Windows]]

== Steps ==
===In a Browser===
#In any browser, you can go to View &gt;&gt; Zoom In to magnify what's present on the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in on a PC Step 1 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom in on a PC Step 1-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom in on a PC Step 1 Version 2.jpg}}
===Using the Mouse and Keyboard===
#Use the scroll wheel on your mouse. Press and hold the {{keypress|ctrl}} key; then scroll up with your mouse's scroll wheel or laptop's trackpad to zoom in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in on a PC Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom in on a PC Step 2-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom in on a PC Step 2 Version 2.jpg}}
#Alternatively, press and hold the {{keypress|ctrl}} key, then press {{keypress|+}} to zoom in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in on a PC Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom in on a PC Step 3-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom in on a PC Step 3 Version 2.jpg}}
#Return your zoom to default. Press {{keypress|ctrl}} and then the {{keypress|0}} (zero) key to return the screen to its original/normal magnification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in on a PC Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom in on a PC Step 4-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom in on a PC Step 4 Version 2.jpg}}
===Using Magnifier===
#Open Magnifier. Windows PCs have an accessibility tool called Magnifier that you can hold over parts of the screen for readability and ease of usage. Launch the tool by going to Start → Programs → Accessories → Accessibility → Magnifier. Click on the magnifying glass icon to manage its settings or to turn it off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{whvid|Zoom in on a PC Step 5 Version 2.360p.mp4|Zoom in on a PC Step 5-preview Version 2.jpg|Zoom in on a PC Step 5 Version 2.jpg}}
#*Setting Magnifier to &quot;Full Screen&quot; mode magnifies your entire screen.
#*Setting Magnifier to &quot;Lens&quot; mode creates an magnified area that follows your mouse pointer, much like a real magnifying glass.
#*You may also adjust the zoom level of your Magnifier.
